# Hand Gesture Recognizer

The Hand Gesture Recognizer is a computer vision project that utilizes advanced image processing techniques to recognize and interpret hand gestures in real-time. It can accurately identify gestures such as "OK," "NOT OK," "HI," and "SUPERB," displaying the recognized gesture on the screen.

## Technologies Used
- OpenCV: Used for image processing and computer vision tasks.
- CV2: A Python library that provides functions for handling images and videos.
- Keras: A deep learning framework used for building and training the gesture recognition model.
- TensorFlow: An open-source machine learning platform used as a backend for Keras.
- Teachable Machine by Google: Used to upload datasets and train the custom gesture recognition model.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/hand-gesture-recognizer.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Ensure that you have Python and the necessary libraries (OpenCV, CV2, Keras, TensorFlow) installed.

## Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Position your hand in front of the camera.
3. Make one of the predefined gestures (OK, NOT OK, HI, SUPERB) in front of the camera.
4. The application will recognize the gesture and display it on the screen in real-time.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you want to enhance the project or add new features, please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m 'Add your commit message here'`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
5. Submit a pull request.

## Future Improvements
- Increase the number of recognized gestures.
- Improve the accuracy of gesture recognition through additional training and data augmentation.
- Implement a more robust hand detection algorithm.
